		    	<h2>What are the basics?</h2>
		    		<br>
		    		<br>
					<p><strong>Opportunities</strong> are the unique and one of a kind celebrity experiences that fans can win.</p>
					<br>
					<p><strong>Cultures</strong> are the different categories that the opportunities fall under. For example: You would find the opportunity to win tickets to a concert and/or backstage passes after the show under the Music category.</p>
					<br>
					<p><strong>Causes</strong> are the different categories that the charities falls under. For example: You would find the charity Feeding America under the Food Chain category.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Fans can <strong>Donate To Win</strong> each opportunity they are interested in. Every $5 donation gives them one entry into the sweepstakes. When the opportunity has expired, a winner will be announced.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Fans will also be able to <strong>Bid To Win certain</strong> opportunities. The winner is the highest bidder at the time that the opportunity expires. The only money collected is that from the winner. To Buy It Now, the fan must pay the Buy It Now price. Once that is done, the bidding is over and the opportunity is won.</p>
					<br>
					<p>For each opportunity, there will be one option (donate or bid) with one winner or both options with two winners.</p>
					<br>
					<p> Users can gift each other in $5 increments. Gifts can be used by the recipient to donate to the charity or opportunity of their choice.</p>
					<br>
				<h2>Where will the charities come from?</h2>
					<br>
					<p>We will use already existing relationships and networking to create partnerships with the charities.</p>
					<br>
				<h2>Why will charities partner with SparkPlugg?</h2>
					<br>
					<p>Charities have already expressed interest and excitement in SparkPlugg due to the fact that there will be very little time required and no financial investment from them to generate large donations through SparkPlugg.</p>
					<br>
				<h2>Where will the opportunities come from?</h2>
					<br>
					<p>We will work with celebrities that are already partnered with the various charities to create the opportunities. We will also use existing relationships and networking to team up with celebrities who would like to be involved.</p>
					<br>
				<h2>Why will celebrities partner with Sparkplugg?</h2>
					<br>
					<p>Different celebrities will partner with SparkPlugg for different reasons. Some celebrities are driven by the passion they have for the causes that matter to them most. Others are looking for some positive PR or a new way to promote themselves. Others would love to further connect with their fans and grow their fanship.</p>
					<br>
				<h2>Why will fans donate?</h2>
					<br>
					<p>There are two main motivations for donating. The first is the desire to support various causes that a fan is passionate about. It feels good to help others and it’s inspirational to be part of a community where you’re making a difference. Imagine your $5 is part of $100,000 that is raised for your favorite charity. It just feels good. The bonus is the chance to win an incredible opportunity!</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p>For others, the opportunity is what drives them. Imagine you’re at a concert or sporting event to see your very favorite musician or athlete. For only $5, you have the chance to meet them after the show or game. Why not? And you’re supporting a great cause in the process! Or you’ve always had the dream to meet your favorite actor. There are two chances to meet him or her, one is a Donate To Win and the other is through bidding. You Bid To Win and your dream just came true.</p>
					<br>
					<p>In addition, Sparkplugg makes fans feel more connected to their favorite celebrity than ever before. Fans are given the opportunity to support their favorite celebrity and work with them to support the charity they are most passionate about.</p>
					<br>
				<h2>What will the fans receive in return for donating?</h2>
					<br>
					<p>In addition to feeling good and possibly winning an incredible opportunity, fans may also receive rewards for their donations. Rewards might include a free download of a song or discounted tickets to an event.</p>
					<br>
				<h2>How can we trust the charities we are donating to?</h2>
					<br>
					<p>Sparkplugg with vet all charities so that fans may be confident that their money is making an impact and going to those who need it most.</p>
					<br>
				<h2>What are the fees?</h2>
					<br>
					<p>Sparkplugg will take a 10% licensing fee from all donations and bids. This may or may not include the fan’s payment processing fee. This will be determined once we are closer to going live. The remaining 87-90% will go to the charity.</p>
					<br>
				<h2>What will happen after the winner is announced?</h2>
					<br>
					<p>It will depend on the type of opportunity. If the fan is at a live event, the celebrity’s team will handle the backstage logistics. If the fan is winning an experience or tickets to an event, Sparkplugg will facilitate the logistics of getting there (including costs covered by travel sponsors). Once the fan is at the experience, the celebrity’s team will take over.</p>
